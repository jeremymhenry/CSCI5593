# CSCI5593

STEPS TO RUN THE SPOILER ALERT PROGRAM 

 

Step 1: Environment setup 

Window or  

Linux 

Step 2: Copy the main.c file to the environment from where you want to run.  

You may want to copy it to a folder in your local machine like //Submission/main.c   

 Step 3: Open the Command window: Start > enter ‘cmd’ > select Command Prompt 

Step 4: Navigate to the folder to where you copied the main.c file  

(In Window, when you need to access the System32 folder located in "C:\Windows," type "cd windows\system32\") 

 

Step 5: Compile and Run the program using the commands below 

In Window, use: 

gcc main.c –o main <enter> 

main > result.csv <enter> 

 

In Linux, use: 

gcc main.c -o main <enter> 

./main > results.csv <enter> 

 

Step 6: View the results 

The results.csv file will be created in the same folder with the main.c file 

Open the results.csv file, you will see a list of numbers which are the time measurement between ‘store’ and ‘load’ instructions in the program. 

You can plot these numbers into a graph using Excel to view them easily. We put the results_SpoilerTeam.xlsx file which already includes the graph in case you don’t want to perform the plot step. 

Step 7: Enjoy your output.
